[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mRelief/documents_api.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/mRelief/documents_api)

# About

This is a prototype API to help families applying for public assistance understand the documents they need to submit with their application.

# Public assistance progams

Our goal is to start with documents needed to apply for Illinois SNAP.

Data sources:

+ [Illinois SNAP Guidelines](http://www.dhs.state.il.us/OneNetLibrary/27897/documents/Brochures/124D.pdf)
+ Interviews with SNAP administration staff

      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

# Data structure for documents

See `data.rb` for examples.

This is a work in progress.

Structure:

```
{
  official_name: "Pay Stubs",
  accessible_name: "Pay Stubs",
  description: "A document describing your income before taxes are taken out",
  instructions: {
    text: "If you don't get paystubs from your employer," \
          " SNAP office will send your employer a letter.",
    urls: []
  },
  examples: [],
  images: [],
  url_to_document: nil,
  url_to_explanation: nil,
  contact: {
    name: "IL Department of Human Services",
    location: nil,
    phone_number: "800-843-6154",
    url: "www.dhs.state.il.us"
  }
}
```

# URL endpoints

## Working endpoint:

https://documents-api.herokuapp.com/api?household_members%5B0%5D%5Bchild_under_18%5D=false&household_members%5B0%5D%5Bdisability_benefits%5D=false&household_members%5B0%5D%5Bis_employee%5D=false&household_members%5B0%5D%5Bself_employed%5D=false&household_members%5B0%5D%5Breceiving_child_support%5D=false&household_members%5B0%5D%5Bis_retired%5D=false&household_members%5B0%5D%5Breceiving_unemployment_benefits%5D=false&is_applying_for_expedited=false&has_rental_income=false

## Scripts for generating endpoints

___(FYI: these are broken and don't create the query string format above, which is generated by jQuery.)___

Local testing:

```
ruby scripts/generate_endpoints.rb localhost:4567
```

Testing against Heroku app:

```
ruby scripts/generate_endpoints.rb documents-api.herokuapp.com
```
